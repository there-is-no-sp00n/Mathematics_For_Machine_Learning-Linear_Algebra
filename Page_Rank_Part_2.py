# GRADED FUNCTION
# Complete this function to provide the PageRank for an arbitrarily sized internet.
# I.e. the principal eigenvector of the damped system, using the power iteration method.
# (Normalisation doesn't matter here)
# The functions inputs are the linkMatrix, and d the damping parameter - as defined in this worksheet.
# (The damping parameter, d, will be set by the function - no need to set this yourself.)

# Do note, this is calculating the eigenvalues of the link matrix, L,
# without any damping. It may give different results that your pageRank function.
# If you wish, you could modify this cell to include damping.
# (There is no credit for this though)

# You may wish to view the PageRank graphically.
# This code will draw a bar chart, for each (numbered) website on the generated internet,
# The height of each bar will be the score in the PageRank.
# Run this code to see the PageRank for each internet you generate.
# Hopefully you should see what you might expect
# - there are a few clusters of important websites, but most on the internet are rubbish!
